Full Stack React web app about 4 clubs(Box, Football ,BasketBall,BaseBall) users in home oage can choose a club then see the club's posts and like them even interact with the posts by pressing detail word, to add comments, even i main page of the posts they can like or delete the posts(here if I learn Authorization I can prevent that anyone can delete any posts)
after registering you can see your profile dashboard and from there, by pressing create post , user can make a new post. also in nav bar they can see the profile section then by pressing their username they move back to the profile dasshboard.

the thing that i am proud of in this code is saving images which user choose from his/her system transmits to string and it going to be saved as string in database, it took almost a day to learn , however I still have some issue with logic of the code, but it worked perfectly.

other thing that took so much time choosing how to create such a app, as first step i had to declare that what I wanna use and show, so I start to design database and make plan how many tables I need and how tables should be in touch to each other

this app can grow technically by learning Authentication and Authorisation I was about learning the authentication for using in react but deadline and my condition did not alow me to keep on
I also wished to create update or edit button to change the details of posts but I stoped doing this because I want keep new thing for new projects
